This project is based on Oracle Database (Version: 10g). 
• Our project is about R.A.W database management system. It is basically a desktop-based software system which is helping to provide freelancing services.
• As we recently started the project work, it is an ongoing event.

Simple Intro of the Database System of the R.A.W:
• There are 3 types of users for this project.
  1. Buyer,
  2. Seller &
  3. Admin
• Buyer, Seller and Admin information is highly secured with their “Security Password” and “Unique Username”.
• In this software, a buyer can post a job and multiple sellers can request for that job willingly. This is the starting of the whole process.
• R.A.W management system also has a well-planned and organized account managing system. So, the transfer of the money from buyer account to seller account and deduction of admin percentage is clearly visible.
• Last of all it is basically a well-planned and organized software system and the moto of the R.A.W management system is: Your security, Our Priority
